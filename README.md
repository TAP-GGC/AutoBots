## :loudspeaker: About
AutoBots is a maze puzzle where students get to learn how image recognition works with robots and how
proper data training is essential for robots to recognize images.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants train their own Convolutional Neural Network to recognize custom hand gestures and allow control of a Makeblock Mbot Mega. Students get to create their own distinct dataset based on images captured of their hand. The robot would then navigate through some obstacles and each gesture would reflect how well the robot could recognize those images.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
In this project, students will design custom hand gestures or images to represent specific movements or commands for an MBot robot. Using image recognition and machine learning, students will train a model to recognize these gestures and teach the robot to react accordingly—whether it’s moving forward, turning, stopping to navigating obstacles. This hands-on project will allow students to develop their skills in image recognition, AI model training, and robotics control, while exploring the complexities and challenges of creating real-world applications using AI and robotics technologies.

* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an education tool for children to learn computing in a fun and interactive way.
* Scratch has drag-and-drop interfaces. Unlike text-based programming language like Java or C where you physically type every line of code, in Scratch, you can drag and drop pre-made codes and organize them into an algorithm. It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle!
* Autobots uses MBlock, which is a Scratch program that comes along with the MBot. While MBlock is Scratch-based, it also contain Google's teachable machine, which helps train the MBot in image recognition.

## Usage
<i> Post connection to the MBot with MBlock open with the correct link. WEBCAM IS NEEDED. </i> 
1. On the sprite tab, scroll down from the open bar where all code blocks are stored.
2. If done correctly, there is a block for teachable machine. Click on it.
3. On top of the block codes, there is a Create/Manage model. Click on it.
4. Scroll down and select Image Recognition (or alike).
5. Ensure that webcam is enabled/turned on. Create desired amount of classes.
6. Using the webcam, take a single or multiple pictures of your desired object. In this case, hands would be the object.
7. Do this for all classes. Ensure that each object is distinct from each other.
8. When finished, change model settings to your desired preference. For this project, keep settings default. Click on train model.
9. When finished, webcam should turn on. Test your objects to ensure right classes are being identified.
10. If correct, click on the top left to use model.
11. While on the sprite tab, replace all instances of model name and classes to your model/class naming convention.
12. Run code to test if models and classes are working. If it is not working, check if all instances are correctly placed (i.e. Stop function is replaced with Stop class equivalent). Otherwise, you just made your first Convolutional Neural Network model!
