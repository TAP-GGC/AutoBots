![step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030981c0-742c-4339-a17b-420a79022e1b)

It should lead to a home screen as shown above.

### Step 2. Turn on the MBot

If charged, the MBot should turn on with 2 lights. 1 red light for the megapi and 1 blue light for Bluetooth. Once turned on, the blue light will blink periodically.
If it is not blinking or light is not on, check if Bluetooth is slotted in correctly into the megapi.


### Step 3. Scroll down and click "Source Code"

![Step 4 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49780ab0-de5b-45e4-9892-6e07f7acfdd4)

To the left, locate the "Device" tab and click on it.

Connect to the MBot. Please enable Bluetooth on your device if you had not done so already.

If done right, the blue light in the MBot will stop blinking and is now connected.

### Option 1: Sharing the file via Google Drive

If you have a Google Drive/OneDrive account that is accessible to your classroom, you can take the downloaded [.sb3](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Code/Complete%20Code%20for%20the%20Game.sb3) file and upload it somewhere that your students can easily access it.

Once they’ve downloaded the file, they can follow the same steps taken in Step 2 of the [Accessing the Workshop File](#step-2-uploading-to-cs-first) segment of this document. 

### Option 2: Sharing the File via Flash Drive

<b>The</b> <a href="https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Code/Complete%20Code%20for%20the%20Game.sb3">.sb3</a> <b>file will have to be downloaded onto a flash drive and uploaded to EVERY individual computer.</b>
</p>

* Upload the file to each student's individual computer using the flash drive. 

* Open up Documents, Go to the Downloads folder, and Drag and drop the file from the flash drive folder into your students downloads folder

* Once the file is transferred over to the Student computer, follow the same steps taken in [Step 2: Accessing the Workshop File](#step-2-uploading-to-cs-first) 

### Option 3: Contact IT/Administration

If you don’t have permission to use Google Drive/OneDrive to share the file or don’t have access to a flash drive, you can contact your school’s administration or IT office to see if the .sb3 file can be uploaded remotely to your classroom's computers.
