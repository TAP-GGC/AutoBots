It should lead to a home screen as shown above.

### Step 2. Turn on the MBot

If charged, the MBot should turn on with 2 lights. 1 red light for the megapi and 1 blue light for Bluetooth. Once turned on, the blue light will blink periodically.
If it is not blinking or light is not on, check if Bluetooth is slotted in correctly into the megapi.


### Step 3. Scroll down and click "Source Code"
